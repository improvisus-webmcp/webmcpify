# Changelog

All notable changes to WebMCPify are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Provider-agnostic baseline execution for Gemini, Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity CLI (`agy`).
- Raw agent trajectory capture in `trajectories/baseline.json`.
- Independent Playwright/Chrome checks for catalog rendering, roast filtering, cart updates, localStorage persistence, reload persistence, and login state.
- Executable discovery through `PATH`, Codex VS Code extension installs, and optional `.env` overrides.
- `.env.example` for local provider and Chrome path configuration without committing machine-specific settings.
- Optional MCP configuration bridging for providers that support it.

### Changed

- Baseline no longer requires a pre-existing `.mcp.json`, native WebMCP registration, or WebMCP-enabled source code. A plain site is a valid baseline starting point.
- Missing optional MCP configuration is skipped instead of failing the baseline.
- Baseline trajectories are saved in WebMCPify's tracked `trajectories/` directory regardless of the directory from which the command is launched.
- CLI failures now print a concise error instead of an uncaught stack trace.

### Architectural note

The agent runner is intentionally provider-agnostic so baseline results are reproducible across supported coding agents rather than being tied to Claude Code. The independent evaluator remains separate from the agent session so pass/fail results are based on live site behavior, not the agent's self-report.

Cross-provider pass-rate comparisons are pending additional runs using the same site and task list.
